FOR HOMEWORK 2:

Database connection URL did not work even tho my credentials were correct. I noticed it did not work for you as well in the video you shared with us. 

I created dataframe for each dimension and saved each dataframe as csv file respectively. 

Then uploaded csv file to the table it belongs to in DataGrip. 

Afterwards, I connected PostgreSQL to Tableau to create visualizations.
